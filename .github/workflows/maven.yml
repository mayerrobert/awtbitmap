# How do I download an action artifact from GitHub?
# * On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
# * Under your repository name, click Actions.
# * In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
# * From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.
# * Under Artifacts, click the artifact you want to download.
